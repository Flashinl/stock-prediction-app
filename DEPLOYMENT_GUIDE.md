## üì± Quick Fix: Access from Phone (Same WiFi)

**Your app is currently running locally. To access from your phone:**

1. **Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi network** as your computer
2. **Open Safari on your phone** and go to: `http://192.168.1.180:5000`

If this doesn't work, your computer's firewall might be blocking connections.

2. **Click "Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall"**
3. **Click "Change Settings" ‚Üí "Allow another app"**
4. **Browse to your Python installation** (usually `C:\Users\vkris\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe`)
5. **Check both "Private" and "Public" networks**
6. **Click OK**

### Option B: Temporarily Disable Firewall (Not Recommended)
